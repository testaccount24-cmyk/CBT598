Sam,

This is about all that I found that was worth anything.
I didn't find any of the JCL I had used to assemble or
execute any of this stuff.

I started out on DOS/VS in 1977.  This was DOS/VS
Release 34 and before DOS/VS became DOS/VSE.

I started working with MVS in 1982 when it was MVS/SP 3.8.
This was before XA, ESA, OS/390, and whatever it is called
now (Z/os?).  All this stuff was 24-bit.... whoever thought
that we would need more than a 16-Meg address space?

I wrote most of this as learning exercises when I first
started working with MVS. I'm sure that this stuff has
plenty of bugs.  None of it requires any APF authorization
so it shouldn't cause too much damage if it blows up.
